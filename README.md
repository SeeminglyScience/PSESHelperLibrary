# PSESHelperLibrary

The PSESHelperLibrary module provides tools to assist in interacting with PowerShell Editor Services along with some
commands for general editing use.

This project is at a very early stage and does not currently have an official release. But feel free to try it out
and let me know needs to change.

## Features

Here is a brief demo of one feature, the `Expand-MemberExpression` command.
